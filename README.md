<b>User’s Guide:</b>

Welcome to the Zoo! In the Zoo you can find Rafi the Bunny. Rafi has a head, a tummy, two ears, hands, and feet. Henry loves carrots so he always keeps some near by. Currently, Henry has two carrots next to him.

<b>Building the Zoo</b>

Ground-Planed Surface: The Zoo exists on a plane of grass that spans as far as Rafi can see. 

Over 3 Solid, Jointed, continually flexing shapes: In the Zoo, Rafi and both of his carrots are 3D shapes at different ground-plane locations, with continually changing joint angles.

Obviously different-looking Materials for each separate object: In the Zoo, Rafi loves to disco! Not only are the carrots and Rafi made of different materials and so are the carrot’s stems, but try pressing the “m” key to enter the disco!


<b>Life at the Circus</b>


5-DOF Camera Control: Try moving to see a different view of Rafi!

One ‘headlight’ light source attached to the camera that users can switch on/off: To turn the headlight on and off press the “p” key

One light source at user-adjustable 3D world-space position, that users can switch on/off, and separate, user-adjustable R, G, B values for ambient, diffuse, and specular light amounts: To turn the overhead light on and off press the “o” key.
<li>"1" key = adjust red ambient</li>
<li>"2" key = adjust green ambient</li>
<li>"3" key = adjust blue ambient</li>
<li>"4" key = adjust red diffuse</li>
<li>"5" key = adjust green diffuse</li>
<li>"6" key = adjust blue diffuse</li>
<li>"7" key = adjust red specular</li>
<li>"8" key = adjust green specular</li>
<li>"9" key = adjust blue specular</li>

In order to "shift" the way you are adjusting, just click the "shift" key!
